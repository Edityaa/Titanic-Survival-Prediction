# Titanic Survival Predictor
![Titanic Sinking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yourusername/your-repositoryname/main/path/to/titanic-sinking-image.jpg)
This is a web application that predicts the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic using logistic regression. Users can input various passenger details such as age, sex, passenger class, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, fare, and port of embarkation. Based on these inputs, the application predicts whether the passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster.

## Features

- Allows users to input passenger details.
- Utilizes logistic regression for survival prediction.
- Displays the prediction result on the website.
- Provides an interactive map showing the port of embarkation.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: Python web framework used for the backend.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend development.
- Leaflet: JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- Logistic Regression: Machine learning algorithm used for survival prediction.
- Used pandas and sklearn for the development of the model
